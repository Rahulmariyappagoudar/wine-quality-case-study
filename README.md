# Wine Quality Case Study

## Overview
This project analyzes wine quality using a dataset containing physicochemical properties of wine samples. The goal is to explore patterns, identify key factors affecting quality, and apply machine learning models for prediction.

## Dataset
- File: `Wine Quality Dataset.csv`
- Contains physicochemical attributes of red and white wines.
- Quality score ranges from 0 to 10.

## Steps
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2. Identify correlations between attributes and quality.
3. Train machine learning models to predict quality.
4. Evaluate model performance.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Jupyter Notebook
